# CapX
This repository contains the code developed during my internship at CAPX Company, where I worked on a stock analysis project. The goal of the project was to implement various stock analysis techniques to analyze historical stock data, identify trends, and generate insights to support investment decisions.

Objective: Develop a machine learning model that predicts stock movements by
scraping data from social media platforms like Twitter, Reddit, or Telegram. The
model should extract insights from user-generated content, such as stock
discussions, predictions, or sentiment analysis, and accurately forecast stock price
trends.

Key Features:
Stock Data Collection: Utilizes APIs to gather historical stock prices and financial data for CAPX and other relevant companies.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing stock data for analysis, including handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.

Technical Indicators: Implementation of common stock analysis indicators such as Moving Averages (SMA, EMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, and more.

Data Visualization: Visualizes stock price trends, technical indicators, and patterns using libraries like Matplotlib and Plotly.

Predictive Models: Basic machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to forecast stock prices or trends based on historical data.

Analysis Reports: Generates performance reports and key metrics, such as risk analysis and return on investment (ROI).

Technologies Used:

Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)

Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

APIs (Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance)

Google Colab for documentation and analysis
